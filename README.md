## Tutorial
For given input values of the aspect ratio and perimeter of the particle, adimensional lineic adhesion energy and adimensional membrane tension, this code allows you to:
- display the variation of the adimensional energy with respect to the wrapping degree
- determine the wrapping phase at equilibrium

The values of wrapping_list, sampling_points_membrane and sampling_points_circle are expected to be kept unchanged, as they result from convergence studies. 

To run the code in terminal, execute the command bellow to set the input parameters. 

```sh
python uptake_of_random_rigid_elliptic_particle.py \
    --r_bar 1 \
    --particle_perimeter 6.28 
```

To run it with the default values (r_bar = 1 and particle_perimeter = 2pi), execute only the following command:
```sh
python uptake_of_random_rigid_elliptic_particle.py
```

Remark: Depending on your python version, you might use a different command than "python", as "py", "py3" or "python3" for instance. 

It is also possible to run the code from any Python development environment. It will run the code written in the main section.
